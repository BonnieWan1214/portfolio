I plan to redesign my landing page by introducing an interactive Circular Gallery that immediately showcases selected projects through motion and spatial interaction. Instead of leading with a traditional self-introduction, the landing page will foreground my work.
When users enter the site, a featured project will first pop up as the visual focal point. Subsequently, the remaining projects will expand outward, forming a semi-circular horizontal row. Users can scroll left or right to browse through the projects, and clicking on any project will lead to a Work page that consolidates all of my portfolio projects.
This punch-up focuses on enhancing the entry experience of my portfolio rather than adding a new project, creating a more engaging and memorable first impression for visitors.

For implementation, I plan to use shadcn UI for reusable components and layout, and OGL to handle the interactive 3D or animated effects in the gallery
